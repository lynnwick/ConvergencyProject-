Convergency Assignment
The project began with Binary Arithmetic for example to re write base-10 numbersar8-bit two compliment or interpret it as an 8-bit two's complement integer how that would look. Drawing a circuit inputs x and y or Boolean logic (AB+C)D. The Linux assignment writing commands from a list at the Linux terminal on the AWS VM (on which I completed in GMIT labs), and had to interpret the output. I had write a shell script using the VIM text editor in order automate execution of the commands.
